              Stadiums of the Future: How Data Collection is Bringing New Life

            <p class="para-blog">
              Sunday, February 13th, 6:30pm EST: the NFL’s top two teams, the
              Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals, will square off in
              the 56th annual Super Bowl showdown. Millions will be watching
              from the comfort of their own homes, but 70,000+ people will be in
              attendance at the new, state-of-the art technological masterpiece
              in SoFi Stadium. Home to the Rams and the Chargers (the other
              LA-based NFL team), this 3.1 million square-foot arena comes
              equipped with all the new digital gizmos and gadgets, creating an
              encapsulating and borderline magical environment for the fans.
            </p>

            <p class="para-blog">
              At the heart of any sport is its fans, which is why SoFi Stadium
              was built to host epic football games, ones to give attendees the
              top-tier experience they deserve. So, how did the physical and
              digital architects of SoFi Stadium know what features to include
              within it in order to increase attendance and elevate the fan
              experience? They collected and referred to lots of data, of
              course.

                <h2 class="fw-bold">Bringing The Fans Back</h2>
                <p class="para-blog">
                  SoFi Stadium boasts a 70,000 square foot video board, also
                  known as the “Infinity Screen”, providing every fan in
                  attendance with additional on-field angles, replays, and other
                  captivating graphics that help illustrate what’s happening in
                  the game below. SoFi Stadium was built with the intention of
                  using digital displays for all their content needs, from
                  advertising efforts to the concession menus. Due to blistering
                  WiFi connectivity speeds powered by more than 2,500 access
                  points within the arena, fans are more than reaping the
                  reward. For example, attendees can enter the stadium by
                  scanning their mobile tickets directly onto the turnstiles,
                  allowing for a seamless passageway in. They can also shop for
                  merchandise and buy food directly from the digital wallets
                  right from their mobile devices. Emphasizing the stadium’s and
                  its supporting digital applications ease-of-use is a
                  calculated maneuver. By giving fans all the tools they need to
                  eliminate the normal stadium experience pain points (e.g. long
                  lines to get into the stadium and to buy food), the experience
                  naturally becomes more positive. Everyone wants to feel like a
                  V.I.P. - the mission of SoFi Stadium is to make all who enter
                  feel like one.
                </p>

                <p class="para-blog">
                  Let’s go a few steps back and first understand why fan
                  attendance is crucial for sports organizations to maintain.
                  Simply, it’s a critical source of revenue for teams. Revenue
                  generated from ticket sales, parking, merchandise, food,
                  beverage, and any other stadium-related expenses help finance
                  a team’s various business operations. A healthy fan following
                  and attendance rate also proves that the product you’re
                  selling (in this case, the team itself) is of high value and
                  can help renegotiate existing sponsorship deals or even
                  attract bigger ones to elevate the organization to new
                  heights. That being said, teams have been fighting an uphill
                  battle against another fierce competitor in the battle for
                  live sports viewership: the at-home experience.
                </p>

                <p class="para-blog">
                  In recent history, sports fans seem to prefer watching events
                  from their couch instead of at the stadium. One of the main
                  reasons for the popularity of home viewing boils down to
                  comfortability. Being able to put your feet up on the table,
                  surrounded by people you’re comfortable with, eating the food
                  that’s in arm's reach and going to the bathroom just down the
                  hall are a few perks that help explain the decision. Now that
                  televisions are capable of producing crystal clear, HD
                  content, we already feel quite immersed in the game, even
                  through a screen.
                </p>

                <p class="para-blog">
                  Also, 80% of sports viewers say that they’re using their
                  computers or smartphones to engage in additional sports
                  content while watching sporting events live on TV. As we can
                  see, fans are taking every opportunity to immerse themselves
                  into the sports world, whether it be to watch multiple games
                  at once, check on their fantasy team performances, or shoot
                  out a tweet to express how cool that catch was. With the
                  living room sofa winning over so many sports fans, coaxing
                  them back into stadiums may seem like a challenging feat. But,
                  while the war is far from over, the top marketing minds among
                  sports organizations have begun to crack the code. By driving
                  live engagement, as seen in SoFi stadium, sports teams can
                  recapture the magic of in-person spectatorship and once again
                  fill their seats with excited and passionate supporters.

                <h2 class="fw-bold ">
                  Using Facts and Figures to Game Plan
                </h2>
              <p class="para-blog">
                At the end of the day, there are two keys to bolstering fan engagement, being digitally-oriented stadiums and digital ticket systems. To expand a little more on the new futuristic sports behemoths being built like SoFi stadium, the end goal of building these arenas is simple: to keep spectators in their seats for longer so that they can watch more of the game, absorb more content, and generally derive more value from the experience as a whole. To do this, programmers involved with SoFi Stadium have created applications that allow attendees to order food and drinks to their seats and guide them to the least crowded bathroom, among other uses.
              </p>




              <p class="para-blog">
                Making spectators’ stadium experience more efficient is one thing, but maintaining their engagement is another. As we know, people like to use multiple devices when watching sports from home in order to keep up with seemingly never-ending additional content. Stadiums have recognized this need, and have put ramped up the content on their jumbotrons (or in SoFi’s case, the “Infinity Screen”). Now, you may see key matchup and player stats from the current game being displayed, as well as important updates from other games around the league. There’s no need for multiple screens when one can cover it all. 
              </p>




              <p class="para-blog">
                There are tons of examples of sports teams from other leagues and even countries that are hopping on the fan engagement wave as well.

                For example, at the Allianz Arena, home to Bayern Munich (one of the top soccer clubs in Germany), fans were quite interested in the narrative surrounding games, not just the games themselves. Therefore, the club installed additional TV screens throughout the stadium, both inside and out, portraying relevant team stats for people to absorb before arriving at their seats. At the Sleep Train Arena, where the Sacramento Kings of the NBA play, fans who were high up in the stands felt especially disconnected from the game down below. So, in order to enhance their experience, team players and personnel were equipped with smart glasses during warmups to offer fans a more intimate view of the court.

                Now, let’s dive into the rise of digital ticketing systems. As the world becomes increasingly paperless, sports organizations are following suit - but they’re not just doing it for the betterment of the environment. E-ticketing platforms allow organizations to collect massive amounts of data which let them know people’s tendencies during the purchasing process, who’s buying tickets and who's visiting the stadiums on game day. Consequently, teams can better target their fans who are attending the live games, and drive repeat ticket purchases with promotional efforts. Data is constantly being compiled from one game to another, leaving organizations with gold mines of information to continually improve both their product offering and their ability to target new and existing fans as well.

                Another valuable aspect of gathering data through e-ticketing platforms is that it gives teams the ability to forecast attendance and potential no-shows for a particular game. They can then target these customers with emails, for example, to remind them that they can transfer their tickets to somebody else. This way, the team can capitalize on things like concession and merchandise sales to their fullest extent.

                Clearly, sports organizations have two priorities. The first is to offer their loyal fans a fulfilling and engaging live experience, and the second is to make money while doing so. It just so happens that the link between these two massively important goals is data collection, something that we at Potloc know all about.
