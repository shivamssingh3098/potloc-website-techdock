While we attempt to facilitate access or link only to those Third-Party Websites or Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third-Party Websites or Third-Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third-Party Website you access or Third-Party Service you use.</p>

        <p class="txt">
            Limited Collection. Potloc does not gather any of your Personal Information while you are using the Website, except as provided in this Policy. Where you have provided Personal Information or where we have collected Personal Information, it will only be used for the stated purpose, as detailed more specifically in the next sections.
        </p>

        <p class="txt">
            Personal Information collected, purposes and legal basis. The following is a list of Personal Information that Potloc may collect from you when you use the Website and what we use it for.

These Personal Information are used by Potloc, in the context of the consumer surveys it conducts on behalf of its customers, leading to the establishment and transmission of statistics. Potloc's activities actually consist in conducting surveys on behalf of its client towards a targeted audience. Potloc determines the questions asked, and therefore, some of the Personal Information required, depending on the purpose and nature of the survey in question, as well as on the expected results.

</li>
<li>

Except as provided in this Section 3, and in Sections 5 (Mailing List Management) and 6 (Security and Encryption of Information) and unless Potloc’s users expressly consent to receive commercial electronic messages from identified third parties, in which case Potloc would only communicate to such third parties the email addresses of consenting users, Potloc does not divulge any Personal Information collected via the Website to third parties.</p>
     <p class="txt">Moreover, subject to situations where Potloc’s users expressly consent to receive commercial electronic messages from identified third parties, in which case Potloc may sell, rent, trade or license to such third parties the email addresses of consenting users, Potloc does not sell, rent, trade or license any Personal Information regarding its users to third parties.

        to a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with Potloc (in which case we will require such entities to honour this Policy) to properly create consumer research reports or to carry out geolocated campaigns ;
    </li>
    <li>if Potloc merges with another entity, is subject to a corporate reorganization, sells or transfers all or part of its business, assets or shares (in which case we will require such entity to assume our obligations under this Policy, or inform you that you are covered by a new privacy policy).</li>
</ul>
